# Add Key Vault CSI driver to your cluster

You have now created your Key Vault and added the GIT PAT token to it. You also created an identity in the `spring-petclinic` namespace that has access to the Key Vault. As a next step you will need to add the Azure Key Vault CSI driver to your cluster. You can follow the below guidance for this.

- [Upgrade an AKS cluster to use CSI driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-driver#upgrade-an-existing-aks-cluster-with-azure-key-vault-provider-for-secrets-store-csi-driver-support)

## Step by step guidance

1. You will need to install the CSI driver add-on on your AKS cluster.

   ```bash
   az aks enable-addons --addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --name $AKSCLUSTER --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
   ```

1. If you now issue a get pods statement in the kube-system namespace you will notice extra pods stared running for the secret store CSI driver.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system
   ```
