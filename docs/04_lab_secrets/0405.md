# Create a secret provider class to serve secrets from Key Vault to your application

You now have everything in place to start using Key Vault secrets in your application code. You will need to create a secret provider class and update the YAML definition for the config microservice. You can use the below guidance to do so.

- [Sync mounted content with a Kubernetes secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-driver#sync-mounted-content-with-a-kubernetes-secret)
- [Set an environment variable to reference Kubernetes secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-driver#set-an-environment-variable-to-reference-kubernetes-secrets)
- [Secrets Store CSI Driver ENV var](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/topics/set-as-env-var.html)

## Step by step guidance

1. As a first step you will create a _SecretProviderClass_.

   ```bash
   ADTENANT=$(az account show --query tenantId --output tsv)
   
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n spring-petclinic -f -
   apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
   kind: SecretProviderClass
   metadata:
     name: azure-kvname-user-msi
   spec:
     provider: azure
     secretObjects:
     - secretName: gitpatsecret
       type: Opaque
       data: 
       - objectName: gitpat
         key: gitpat
     parameters:
       usePodIdentity: "false"
       useVMManagedIdentity: "false" 
       clientID: $USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID 
       keyvaultName: $KEYVAULT_NAME
       cloudName: "" 
       objects: |
         array: 
           - |
             objectName: GIT-PAT
             objectType: secret   
             objectAlias: gitpat          
             objectVersion: ""  
       tenantId: $ADTENANT
   EOF
   ```

   This SecretProviderClass connects to your Key Vault and picks up the _GIT-PAT_ Key Vault secrets This will get mapped to a secret object in your AKS cluster. The connection to Key Vault is made with the client ID of the user assigned managed identity you created in a previous step.

1. You can now update your YAML deployment definition to make use of this secret and map it to an environment variable for your pod. Navigate to the kubernetes directory and update the `spring-petclinic-config-server.yml` with the contents from the [spring-petclinic-config-server.yml](spring-petclinic-config-server.yml) file. You can again curl the updates for these files and then fill out the correct container registry name.

   ```bash
   curl -o spring-petclinic-config-server.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aks-lab/main/docs/04_lab_secrets/spring-petclinic-config-server.yml

   IMAGE=${MYACR}.azurecr.io/spring-petclinic-config-server:$VERSION
   sed -i "s|#image#|$IMAGE|g" spring-petclinic-config-server.yml
   ```

1. Inspect the new contents of the `spring-petclinic-config-server.yml` file. This file has:

   - 1 additional environment variable that maps the `gitpatsecret` secret created by the `SecretProviderClass`.
   - An `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"` so the pod can make use of the workload identity you configured.
   - A `serviceAccountName: workload-identity-sa` to indicate which service account the pod will be using.
   - An additional `volumes` definition for creating a volume to the secret provider class.
   - An additional `volumeMounts` definition to indicate where the volume needs to be mapped in the container. 

   {: .note }
   > We are not really using the volumes and volumeMounts elements, since your spring boot app will rely on environment variables. However these elements are needed so the secrets get loaded in your kubernetes cluster. In case you don't define volumes and volumeMounts you will notice the secretProviderClass being present in the cluster but no additional secrets get created by it. This is because of how the Key Vault CSI driver works.

1. You will also need to update the `application.yml` file of the `config-server` microservice itself, so it does not make use of the hard-coded GitHub PAT token anymore. Navigate to the _spring-petclinic-config-server/src/main/resources/application.yml_ file and update the password of the git repo to use the `GIT_PAT` environment variable.  

   ```yaml
             password: ${GIT_PAT}
   ```

1. Navigate to the root of the application and rebuild the `spring-petclinic-config-server`.

   ```bash
   cd ~/workspaces/java-microservices-aks-lab/src
   mvn clean package -DskipTests -rf :spring-petclinic-config-server
   ```

1. You will also have to rebuild the container image for the `config-server`. Navigate to the `acr-staging` directory, copy over the compiled jar file and rebuild the container.

   ```bash
   cd staging-acr
   rm spring-petclinic-config-server-$VERSION.jar
   cp ../spring-petclinic-config-server/target/spring-petclinic-config-server-$VERSION.jar spring-petclinic-config-server-$VERSION.jar
   
   docker build -t $MYACR.azurecr.io/spring-petclinic-config-server:$VERSION \
       --build-arg ARTIFACT_NAME=spring-petclinic-config-server-$VERSION.jar \
       --build-arg APP_PORT=8888 \
       --build-arg AI_JAR=ai.jar \
       .

   docker push $MYACR.azurecr.io/spring-petclinic-config-server:$VERSION
   ```

1. Now re-apply the YAML file in your AKS cluster and wait for it to be properly up and running.

   ```bash
   cd ../kubernetes
   kubectl apply -f spring-petclinic-config-server.yml 
   kubectl get pods -w
   ```

1. Once the config-server is properly up and running, escape out of the pod watch statement with `Ctrl+Q`. Delete the pods of the customers, visits and vets microservices. This will make them restart and reload their configuration

   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <customers-service-pod-name> 
   kubectl delete pod <vets-service-pod-name> 
   kubectl delete pod <visits-service-pod-name> 
   ```

1. You should see all your pods properly running again and data being shown in the spring petclinic application.

1. Once you redeployed the microservices, you can check that the secret kubernetes objects got created. In the output you will notice a _gitpatsecret_object.

   ```bash
   kubectl get secrets -n spring-petclinic
   ```

1. In case you see errors or crashloops of your pods, you can use the below statements to diagnose what might be going wrong. A first statement you can try is describe your pod.

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <name-of-the-pod> -n spring-petclinic
   ```

   In the output of the describe statement you should see your environment variables being mapped.

   ```bash
    Environment:
      CONFIG_SERVER_URL:                          <set to the key 'CONFIG_SERVER_URL' of config map 'config-server'>                      Optional: false
      APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING:      <set to the key 'APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING' of config map 'config-server'>  Optional: false
      APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_CONTENT:  {
                                                      "role": {   
                                                          "name": "config-server"
                                                        }
                                                  }
      GIT_PAT:                                    <set to the key 'gitpat' in secret 'gitpatsecret'>  Optional: false
      AZURE_CLIENT_ID:                            xxx
      AZURE_TENANT_ID:                            xxx
      AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE:                 /var/run/secrets/azure/tokens/azure-identity-token
      AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST:                       https://login.microsoftonline.com/
   ```

1. In the logs of a pod you can see specific errors during startup

   ```bash
   kubectl logs <name-of-the-pod> -n spring-petclinic -f
   ```

1. You can also query the environment variables of your pod.

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <name-of-the-pod> -n spring-petclinic -- env 
   ```

   Here as well you should find back the _GIT_PAT_ environment variable with the correct value.

1. And lastly, you can connect to the external service IP of the admin server on port 8080 to inspect whether your applications are properly running and what environment variables are loaded.
