# Update application config

You now have all relevant components in place to switch to the secrets stored in Azure Key Vault and remove them from your config repo. To complete your configuration, you now need to set the config repository to reference the Azure Key Vault instance. You also need to update the **pom.xml** file to ensure that the visits, vets and customers services use the `com.azure.spring:spring-cloud-azure-starter-keyvault-secrets` dependency. You can use the following guidance to accomplish this task:

[Spring Cloud Azure Starter Key Vault Secrets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/spring/README.md)
[Build a sample Spring Boot app with Spring Boot starter](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/spring-apps/tutorial-managed-identities-key-vault?tabs=system-assigned-managed-identity#build-a-sample-spring-boot-app-with-spring-boot-starter)

## Step by step guidance

1. From the Git Bash window, in the config repository you cloned locally, use your favorite text editor to open the `application.yml` file. Replace the contents of this file with the contents of this [application.yml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-asa-standard-lab/tree/main/config/04_application.yml) file. This file contains the following changes:

    * The spring.datasource properties are no longer there. These are now in your Key Vault and are no longer needed in the application.yml file.
    * Line 25 to 32 contain new config for your Key Vault. Make sure you replace the `<your-kv-name>` placeholder on line 31 with the name of your Key Vault.
    
1. Save the file and commit and push these changes to your remote config repository.

   ```bash
   cd ~/workspaces/java-microservices-asa-standard-lab
   git add .
   git commit -m 'added key vault'
   git push
   ```

### Update, rebuild, and redeploy each app

1. From the Git Bash window, in the `java-microservices-asa-standard-lab` repository you cloned locally, use your favorite text editor to open the `pom.xml` files of the customers, visits and vets services (within the `src/spring-petclinic-customers-service`, `src/spring-petclinic-visits-service`, and `src/spring-petclinic-vets-service` directories). For each, add the following dependencies (within the `<dependencies>...</dependencies>` section) and save the change.

   ```xml
           <dependency>
              <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
              <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-keyvault-secrets</artifactId>
           </dependency>
   ```

1. From the Git Bash window, in the `spring-petclinic-microservices` repository you cloned locally, use your favorite text editor to open the `pom.xml` file in the `src` directory of the cloned repo. Add to the file a dependency to `com.azure.spring`. This should be added within the `<dependencyManagement><dependencies></dependencies></dependencyManagement>` section.

   ```xml
       <dependencyManagement>
           <dependencies>
               //... existing dependencies

               <dependency>
                   <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
                   <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</artifactId>
                   <version>${version.spring.cloud.azure}</version>
                   <type>pom</type>
                   <scope>import</scope>
               </dependency>

           </dependencies>
       </dependencyManagement>
   ```

1. In the same file, add a property for `version.spring.cloud.azure`. This should be added within the `<properties></properties>` section.

   ```xml
   <version.spring.cloud.azure>5.2.0</version.spring.cloud.azure>
   ```
    
1. Save the changes to the `pom.xml` file and close it.

1. Rebuild the services by running the following command in the root directory of the application.

   ```bash
   cd ~/workspaces/java-microservices-asa-standard-lab/src
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

1. Verify that the build succeeds by reviewing the output of the `mvn clean package -DskipTests` command, which should have the following format:

   ```bash
   [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ```

1. Redeploy the customers, visits and vets services to their respective apps in your Spring Apps service by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   az spring app deploy \
            --name ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE} \
            --no-wait \
            --artifact-path ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE_JAR} 

   az spring app deploy \
               --name ${VISITS_SERVICE} \
               --no-wait \
               --artifact-path ${VISITS_SERVICE_JAR} 

   az spring app deploy \
               --name ${VETS_SERVICE} \
               --no-wait \
               --artifact-path ${VETS_SERVICE_JAR}
   ```

1. Retest your application through its public endpoint. Ensure that the application is functional, while the connection string secrets are retrieved from Azure Key Vault.

1. In case you don't see data in your application, take a look at the `customers-service` logs to make sure the configuration gets picked up correctly and there are no errors on startup. 

   ```bash
   az spring app logs --name ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE} --follow 
   ```

   {: .note }
   > In case you see no errors, you can escape out of the log statement with `Ctrl+C` and you can proceed with the next steps. In case you see errors, review the steps you executed and retry. The [LabTips file]({% link LabTips.md %}) also contains steps on how to recover from errors.

1. To verify that secrets from Key Vault are picked up, in the Azure Portal, navigate to the page of the Azure Key Vault instance you provisioned. On the Overview page, select the **Monitoring** tab and review the graph representing requests for access to the vault's secrets.
