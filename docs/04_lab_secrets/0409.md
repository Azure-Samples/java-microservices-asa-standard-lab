# Update the applications to use passwordless connectivity

By now all setup on the spring apps service side is done. You will still need to update your microservices to make use of the new passwordless capabilities. To accomplish this, you can use the following the guidance: [Connect an Azure Database for MySQL instance to your application in Azure Spring Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/spring-apps/how-to-bind-mysql?tabs=Service-Connector).

The following three apps of your application use the database hosted by the Azure Database for MySQL Single Server instance, so they will need to have their code updated:

- `customers-service`
- `vets-service`
- `visits-service`

## Step by step guidance

1. From the Git Bash window, in the `java-microservices-asa-standard-lab` repository you cloned locally, use your favorite text editor to open the `pom.xml` files of the customers, visits and vets services (within the `src/spring-petclinic-customers-service`, `src/spring-petclinic-visits-service`, and `src/spring-petclinic-vets-service` directories). For each, replace the `mysql-connector-j` dependency (within the `<dependencies>...</dependencies>` section)  with the `spring-cloud-azure-starter-jdbc-mysql` dependency and save the file:

   ```xml
        <!-- Replace this dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
            <scope>runtime</scope>
        </dependency>
   ```

   ```xml
        <!-- by this dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-jdbc-mysql</artifactId>
        </dependency>
   ```

1. Rebuild the microservices by running the below command in the git bash window:

   ```bash
   cd ~/workspaces/java-microservices-asa-standard-lab/src
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

1. Verify that the build succeeds by reviewing the output of the `mvn clean package -DskipTests` command, which should have the following format:

   ```bash
   [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [INFO] Reactor Summary for spring-petclinic-microservices 3.0.2:

   [INFO] Finished at: 2023-06-02T14:07:49Z
   [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

1. Once the build is complete, redeploy each of the apps.

   ```bash
   az spring app deploy --name ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE} \
       --no-wait \
       --artifact-path ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE_JAR} 
   
   az spring app deploy --name ${VETS_SERVICE} \
       --no-wait \
       --artifact-path ${VETS_SERVICE_JAR} 
   
   az spring app deploy --name ${VISITS_SERVICE} \
       --no-wait \
       --artifact-path ${VISITS_SERVICE_JAR} 
   ```

1. Retest your application through its public endpoint. Ensure that the application is functional, while the connection string secrets are retrieved from Azure Key Vault.

1. In case you don't see data in your application, take a look at the `customers-service` logs to make sure the configuration gets picked up correctly and there are no errors on startup. 

   ```bash
   az spring app logs --name ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE} --follow 
   ```
