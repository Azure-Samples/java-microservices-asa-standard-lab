# Lab 04: Secure application secrets using Key Vault

# Student manual

## Lab scenario

Your team is now running a first version of the `spring-petclinic` microservice application in Azure. However you are concerned that your application secrets are stored directly in configuration code. As a matter of fact, GitHub has been generating notifications informing you about this vulnerability. You want to remediate this issue and implement a secure method of storing application secrets that are part of the database connection string. In this unit, you will step through implementing such method.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Create an Azure Key Vault instance
- Store your connection string elements as Azure Key Vault secrets
- Create a managed identity for your microservices
- Grant the managed identity permissions to access the Azure Key Vault secrets
- Update application config
- Update, rebuild, and redeploy each app
- Delete secrets from Key Vault
- Create an admin account for the MySQL Flexible Server
- Create service connections from the microservices to the database server
- Update the applications to use passwordless connectivity

The below image illustrates the end state you will be building in this lab.
