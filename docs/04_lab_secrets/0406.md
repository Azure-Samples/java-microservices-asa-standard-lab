1. From the Git Bash prompt, run the following command to delete the secrets from your Azure Key Vault instance. The `$KEYVAULT_NAME`, `$LOCATION` and `$RESOURCE_GROUP` variables contain the name of the Key Vault, Azure region and the resource group into which you deployed the Azure Spring Apps service in the previous exercise of this lab.

   ```bash
   az keyvault secret delete --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME --name SPRING-DATASOURCE-URL
   az keyvault secret delete --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME --name SPRING-DATASOURCE-USERNAME
   az keyvault secret delete --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME --name SPRING-DATASOURCE-PASSWORD
   ```
