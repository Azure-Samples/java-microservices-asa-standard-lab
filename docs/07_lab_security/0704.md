# Create the Application Gateway resources

You are now ready to create an Application Gateway instance to expose your application to the internet. You will also need to create a WAF policy, when you use the **WAF_v2** sku for Application Gateway. You can use the following guidance to perform this task:

- [Create Web Application Firewall policies for Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/create-waf-policy-ag).
- [Create the Application Gateway resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spring-cloud/expose-apps-gateway-end-to-end-tls?tabs=self-signed-cert%2Cself-signed-cert-2#create-network-resources).

> An Application Gateway resource needs a dedicated subnet to be deployed into, however, you already created this subnet at the beginning of this exercise.

## Step by step guidance

1. An Application Gateway instance also needs a public IP address, which you will create next by running the following commands from the Git Bash shell:

   ```bash
   APPLICATION_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP_NAME=pip-$APPNAME-app-gw
   az network public-ip create \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --name $APPLICATION_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP_NAME \
       --allocation-method Static \
       --sku Standard \
       --dns-name $DNS_LABEL
   ```

1. In addition, an Application Gateway instance also needs to have access to the self-signed certificate in your Key Vault. To accomplish this, you will create a managed identity associated with the Application Gateway instance and retrieve the object ID of this identity.

   ```bash
   APPGW_IDENTITY_NAME=id-$APPNAME-appgw
   az identity create \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --name $APPGW_IDENTITY_NAME

   APPGW_IDENTITY_CLIENTID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $APPGW_IDENTITY_NAME --query clientId --output tsv)
   APPGW_IDENTITY_OID=$(az ad sp show --id $APPGW_IDENTITY_CLIENTID --query id --output tsv)
   ```

1. You can now reference the object ID when granting the `get` and `list` permissions to the Key Vault secrets and certificates.

   ```bash
   az keyvault set-policy \
       --name $KEYVAULT_NAME \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --object-id $APPGW_IDENTITY_OID \
       --secret-permissions get list \
       --certificate-permissions get list
   ```

   >  It might be that this step fails with an `unauthorized` in case you use a subscription that has additional policy settings and when you run these steps from a codespace. To recover from this error, re-execute these steps in a cloud shell. This should succeed.

   {: .note }
   > In order for this implementation to work, the Application Gateway instance requires access to certificate and secrets in the Azure Key Vault instance.

1. Next, you need to retrieve the ID of the self-signed certificate stored in your Key Vault (you will use it in the next step of this task).

   ```bash
   KEYVAULT_SECRET_ID_FOR_CERT=$(az keyvault certificate show --name $CERT_NAME_IN_KV --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME --query sid --output tsv)
   ```

1. Before you can create the Application Gateway, you will also need to create the WAF policy for the gateway.

    ```bash
    WAF_POLICY_NAME=waf-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
    az network application-gateway waf-policy create \
        --name $WAF_POLICY_NAME \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
    ```
    
1. With all relevant information collected, you can now provision an instance of Application Gateway.

   ```bash
   APPGW_NAME=agw-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID

   az network application-gateway create \
       --name $APPGW_NAME \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --capacity 2 \
       --sku WAF_v2 \
       --frontend-port 443 \
       --http-settings-cookie-based-affinity Disabled \
       --http-settings-port 8080 \
       --http-settings-protocol Http \
       --public-ip-address $APPLICATION_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP_NAME \
       --vnet-name $VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME \
       --subnet $APPLICATION_GATEWAY_SUBNET_NAME \
       --servers $AKS_MC_LB_INTERNAL_FE_IP1 \
       --key-vault-secret-id $KEYVAULT_SECRET_ID_FOR_CERT \
       --identity $APPGW_IDENTITY_NAME \
       --priority "1" \
       --waf-policy $WAF_POLICY_NAME
   ```

   > Wait for the provisioning to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.
