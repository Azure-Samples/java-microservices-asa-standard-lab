# Test your setup

As the last step of this exercise and the lab, test your setup again. You should still be able to navigate to your application through the custom domain that you configured on your Application Gateway and view the listing of owners and veterinarians.

   {: .note }
   > In case you don't see any data when navigating the menu options in the application, try redeploying the customers, visits and vets apps again to Azure Spring Apps.

   {: .note }
   > If things don't work as expected, you can reconnect monitoring for your application and troubleshooting as described in the previous monitoring lab.
