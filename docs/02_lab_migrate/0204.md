# Deploy the Spring Petclinic app components to the Spring Apps service

You now have the compute and data services available for deployment of the components of your applications, including `spring-petclinic-admin-server`, `spring-petclinic-customers-service`, `spring-petclinic-vets-service`, `spring-petclinic-visits-service` and `spring-petclinic-api-gateway`. In this task, you will deploy these components as microservices to the Azure Spring Apps service. You will not be deploying the `spring-petclinic-config-server` and `spring-petclinic-discovery-server` to Azure Spring Apps, since these will be provided to you by the platform. To perform the deployment, you can use the following guidance:

- [Guidance on creating apps on Azure Spring Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/spring-apps/quickstart-deploy-apps?tabs=Azure-CLI&pivots=programming-language-java).

   {: .note }
   > The `spring-petclinic-api-gateway` and `spring-petclinic-admin-server` will have a public endpoint assigned to them.

## Step by step guidance

1. In the src directory parent **pom.xml** file double check the version number on line 9.

    ```bash
       <parent>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
           <version>3.0.2</version>
       </parent>
    ```

1. From the Git Bash window, set a `VERSION` environment variable to this version number `3.0.2`.

   ```bash
   VERSION=3.0.2
   ```

1. You will start by building all the microservice of the spring petclinic application. To accomplish this, run `mvn clean package` in the root directory of the application.

   ```bash
   cd ~/workspaces/java-microservices-asa-standard-lab/src
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

1. Verify that the build succeeds by reviewing the output of the `mvn clean package -DskipTests` command, which should have the following format:

   ```bash
   [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [INFO] Reactor Summary for spring-petclinic-microservices 3.0.2:

   [INFO] spring-petclinic-discovery-server .................. SUCCESS [  2.563 s]
   [INFO] spring-petclinic-api-gateway ....................... SUCCESS [ 15.582 s]
   [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
   [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [INFO] Total time:  55.901 s
   [INFO] Finished at: 2023-06-02T14:07:49Z
   [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

1. You will set a couple of environment variables for the name of each app.

   ```bash
   API_GATEWAY=api-gateway
   ADMIN_SERVER=admin-server
   CUSTOMERS_SERVICE=customers-service
   VETS_SERVICE=vets-service
   VISITS_SERVICE=visits-service
   ```

1. For each application you will now create an app on Azure Spring Apps service. You will start with the `api-gateway`. To deploy it, from the Git Bash prompt, run the following command:

   ```bash
   az spring app create \
            --name $API_GATEWAY \
            --assign-endpoint true
   ```

   {: .note }
   > Wait for the provisioning to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.

1. Next deploy the jar file to this newly created app by running the following command from the Git Bash prompt:

   ```bash
   API_GATEWAY_JAR=spring-petclinic-api-gateway/target/spring-petclinic-api-gateway-$VERSION.jar
   az spring app deploy \
            --name $API_GATEWAY \
            --no-wait \
            --artifact-path ${API_GATEWAY_JAR}
   ```

1. In the same way create an app for the `admin-server` microservice, and deploy it:

   ```bash
   az spring app create \
            --name $ADMIN_SERVER \
            --assign-endpoint true

   ADMIN_SERVER_JAR=spring-petclinic-admin-server/target/spring-petclinic-admin-server-$VERSION.jar
   az spring app deploy \
            --name $ADMIN_SERVER \
            --no-wait \
            --artifact-path ${ADMIN_SERVER_JAR}
   ```

   {: .note }
   > Wait for each operation to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.

1. Next, you will create, and deploy an app for the `customers-service` microservice, without assigning an endpoint:

   ```bash
   az spring app create \
            --name $CUSTOMERS_SERVICE

   CUSTOMERS_SERVICE_JAR=spring-petclinic-customers-service/target/spring-petclinic-customers-service-$VERSION.jar
   az spring app deploy \
            --name $CUSTOMERS_SERVICE \
            --no-wait \
            --artifact-path ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE_JAR}
   ```

   {: .note }
   > Wait for each operation to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.

1. Once deployed, take a look at the `customers-service` logs to make sure the configuration gets picked up correctly and there are no errors on startup.

   ```bash
   az spring app logs --name ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE} --follow 
   ```

   {: .note }
   > In case you see no errors, you can escape out of the log statement with `Ctrl+C` and you can proceed with the next steps. In case you see errors, review the steps you executed and retry. The [LabTips file](../../../LabTips.md) also contains steps on how to recover from errors.

1. Next, you will create, and deploy an app for the `visits-service` microservice, also without an endpoint assigned:

   ```bash
   az spring app create \
               --name $VISITS_SERVICE

   VISITS_SERVICE_JAR=spring-petclinic-visits-service/target/spring-petclinic-visits-service-$VERSION.jar
   az spring app deploy \
               --name $VISITS_SERVICE \
               --no-wait \
               --artifact-path ${VISITS_SERVICE_JAR} 
   ```

   {: .note }
   > Wait for each operation to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.

1. To conclude, you will create, and deploy an app for the `vets-service` microservice, again without an endpoint assigned:

   ```bash
   az spring app create \
               --name $VETS_SERVICE 

   VETS_SERVICE_JAR=spring-petclinic-vets-service/target/spring-petclinic-vets-service-$VERSION.jar
   az spring app deploy \
               --name $VETS_SERVICE  \
               --no-wait \
               --artifact-path ${VETS_SERVICE_JAR}
   ```

   {: .note }
   > Wait for each operation to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.
