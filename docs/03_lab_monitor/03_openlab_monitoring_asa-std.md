# Challenge 03: Enable monitoring and end-to-end tracing

# Student manual

## Challenge scenario

You have created your first Spring Apps service, installed your microservices as apps and exposed them through the `api-gateway`. Now that everything is up and running, it would be helpful to be able to monitor the availability of your apps and detect any errors or exceptions that might occur during their usage. In this lab, you will implement their end-to-end monitoring.

## Objectives

After you complete this challenge, you will be able to:

- Live stream the logs from your apps
- Configure Application Insights to receive monitoring information from your apps
- Analyze app-specific monitoring data
- Configure diagnostics settings
- Analyze logs

The below image illustrates the end state you will be building in this challenge.
